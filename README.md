This project's purpose was to create a web-based chart using an API datset of choice. 
The API of my choice tracks data about public recycling bins across New York City
(https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Public-Recycling-Bins/sxx4-xhzg).
I created a bar chart that demonstarates the amount of paper and MGP bins across the 5 boroughs.
In addition, a pie chart that highlights what percenatge of bins are located in specific building types was made.
I chose this API so the visualizations can demonstrate which boroughs of NYC are in need of more bins 
and to idenifty relationships bewteen recycyling bins and the buildings types where they are mostly found.
